              “Hey, Libby, where are you going?”, shouted William across the hidden depths of the Edelstein Forest,
              “Libby? Libby, come back! I need to talk to you!”
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a typical autumn night in the forest: woodpeckers chirping, windy, and decently cold weather. Libby
              was nowhere to be found, at least so William thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s too late, William. Go back to your fortress. They need you to guard the gem,” Libby said coldly.
            </p>
            <p>“You mean our fortress?”</p>
            <p>“No, I don’t belong there anymore. Now, I really have to go.”</p>
            <p>“But wait!”</p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>“Our gem…Uncle took it.”</p>
            <p>“Uncle Steve passed away two months ago. Who are you talking about?”</p>
            <p>“Uncle Steve. I saw him.”</p>
            <p>“Oh no”, they both muttered slowly.</p>
            <p>
              While William was still processing what he realised, Libby immediately jumped to action. There was a
              golden rule back in the fortress—never leave the gem unsupervised. Except for this time, it was guarded by
              Uncle Steve. It was also stolen by Uncle Steve. Dreadful disasters can happen if the gem was stolen. But
              no one knew what—it had never happened before. Except for now.
